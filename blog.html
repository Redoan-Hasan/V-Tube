            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, each with distinct behaviors regarding scope, hoisting, and mutability. The var keyword is function-scoped, meaning that a variable declared with var is accessible within the function it is declared in, or globally if declared outside any function. One notable characteristic of var is its hoisting behavior: var declarations are moved to the top of their scope, allowing the variable to be referenced before its declaration, albeit with an undefined value until it is assigned. Additionally, var allows for multiple declarations of the same variable within the same scope, which can sometimes lead to unintended consequences and bugs. When declared in the global scope, var becomes a property of the global object (such as window in browsers).</p>

                <p>
                    In JavaScript, null and undefined serve distinct roles, representing the absence of a value but in different contexts and with different intentions. undefined is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not yet assigned a value. It also appears when attempting to access properties of an object that do not exist or when a function does not explicitly return a value. Essentially, undefined signals that a variable has been declared but not yet defined, serving as JavaScript's way of telling the developer that a value is missing or uninitialized. For example, when a function is called with fewer arguments than there are parameters, the missing parameters will be undefined, indicating their absence.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. REST APIs are based on REST, an architectural style for designing networked applications. They use standard HTTP methods and status codes to perform operations on resources, which are typically represented as data objects.</p>
